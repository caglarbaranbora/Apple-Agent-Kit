Status: Stable
Version: 2.1.0

## Overview

Apple Agent Kit is a source-available, spec-first knowledge system for AI coding agents developing Apple platform applications.

The project transforms official Apple documentation into small, atomic Knowledge Contracts that can be deterministically routed through Skills instead of relying on repository-wide semantic search.

## Why

AI coding agents working on Apple platform apps tend to either hallucinate platform conventions or burn tokens re-reading entire doc sets on every task. Apple Agent Kit exists to fix both: it pre-digests official Apple documentation into small, atomic, traceable Knowledge Contracts, and routes an agent to exactly the ones a task needs via deterministic Skills — not semantic search over the whole repo. The result is lower token cost per task, more consistent output across sessions, and a clear paper trail back to the Apple documentation that justifies each rule.

## Goals

- Reduce token usage
- Improve routing accuracy
- Increase implementation consistency
- Preserve traceability to Apple documentation
- Scale to hundreds of reusable Knowledge Contracts

## Installation

Install the Claude Code plugin via the npx installer:

```bash
npx apple-agent-kit
```

This adds this repository as a Claude Code plugin marketplace and installs the `apple-agent-kit` plugin, so its Skills, Knowledge Contracts, and routing become available inside Claude Code sessions. Requires the `claude` CLI to already be installed.

Workflows

## Workflows

A Workflow composes several Skills into one task that no single domain owns. Routing matches Workflows first: if the task spans more than one of the Skills a Workflow names, that Workflow is loaded and sequences them; otherwise exactly one Skill is loaded.

- **`authentication`** — Build a sign-in feature end to end: wording, form accessibility, Sign in with Apple, biometric re-auth, Keychain storage. → [WORKFLOW.md](workflows/authentication/WORKFLOW.md)
- **`app-store-submission`** — Review-guideline compliance and privacy declaration, gated ahead of signing, archive, and export. → [WORKFLOW.md](workflows/app-store-submission/WORKFLOW.md)
- **`add-widget`** — Widget surface, its configuration and interaction intents, and the background refresh that keeps its timeline current. → [WORKFLOW.md](workflows/add-widget/WORKFLOW.md)

## Skills

Skills route a task to the minimum set of Knowledge Contracts it needs. Invoke them with a specific task, not a broad topic request — name the concrete thing you're doing (e.g. "check this screen's layout against HIG"), not "tell me about HIG."

## What's New

- 2026-08-09 — Location support shipped as the first half of a deliberately small pilot, and the pilot immediately earned its keep. The experiment being run is whether writing down every boundary a new domain shares with existing ones *before* authoring a single rule prevents the seam defects that earlier rounds only found by testing end to end. Five such boundaries were written down in advance for location; four survived contact with the actual writing untouched, including the one an agent is most likely to get wrong — that a feature reacting to movement in the background should not schedule a periodic wake-up task, because the location service already relaunches the app itself, so picking one removes the need for the other rather than adding to it. The fifth was right that a boundary exists and wrong about how it could be expressed: it described handing map display off to a domain that has not been built yet, and naming an unbuilt domain in a shipped document is something the automated checks refuse outright, immediately, not later as the note had predicted. The correction is small and the lesson is not: a boundary can be correctly decided and still be unwritable as decided, which is a failure mode advance planning was supposed to eliminate and does not. Four rule documents, a source index, and a router entry landed alongside it, all verified against Apple's own wording rather than recollection.
- 2026-08-08 — Seventeen of the project's domains had never been read against the semantic review standard, and reading them found a defect that was about to be copied into new work. The standard itself is recent; the domains predate it, and the earlier read-through had covered only two domains, both from the other group. Measurements had suggested the older domains were fine — but every one of those measurements came from the automated checks, and the whole lesson of the previous round was that the automated checks are not the ones that find this kind of problem. Reading was aimed rather than exhaustive: every technical identifier appearing in a rule was mapped to the domains claiming it, which narrowed 1,604 names to the 97 where two domains both had something to say. The real finding: two documents tell an agent to wrap a screen component in a particular adapter, and neither points at the document that owns the constraint making the wrap correct — so the agent follows the instruction and never learns the part that keeps it from breaking. A third domain was about to inherit the same gap. Three structural gaps surfaced too, the largest being that the vocabulary for recording how two domains relate could only express whether they overlap, never whether a choice on one side forces a choice on the other — which is exactly the shape of the last two defects found, both in boundaries that had been recorded as clean. What passed is recorded as carefully as what failed, including one proposed automated check that was built, found to flag half the project, and rejected on the spot.
- 2026-08-08 — The last open architectural question was settled against both answers that had been proposed for it, because someone finally counted. Certain tasks need two domains at once — fixing an error message needs both the rule about what the message must explain and the rules about how to word it — and the router can only send a task to one place. The recorded options were to add a combined workflow or to let one router hand off to another; the first was called the smaller change. Counting showed the overlap is not a corner of the design but runs through 29 of 33 documents on the design side, so a combined workflow would have pulled in four times the material for any task involving text, defeating the efficiency the whole project exists for. The second would have permanently weakened a structural rule and was the only option that could not be undone. What shipped instead costs two paragraphs: each side now stops and says which neighbour owns the other half, rather than answering half the question silently. Separately, the next wave of domains opens as a deliberately small pilot — location and photo access — whose purpose is to test a claim rather than to add content. An earlier end-to-end run suggested that boundaries between domains stay clean when they are decided before either side is written, and go wrong when they are left to emerge. All nine boundaries these two share with existing domains are therefore settled in advance, in writing, before a single rule is authored. One of them already caught a conflict that would otherwise have become a duplicated rule discovered much later. If the pilot goes wrong anyway, that is worth learning on two domains rather than nineteen.
