Status: Stable
Version: 2.4.0

## Overview

Apple Agent Kit is a source-available, spec-first knowledge system for AI coding agents developing Apple platform applications.

The project transforms official Apple documentation into small, atomic Knowledge Contracts that can be deterministically routed through Skills instead of relying on repository-wide semantic search.

## Why

AI coding agents working on Apple platform apps tend to either hallucinate platform conventions or burn tokens re-reading entire doc sets on every task. Apple Agent Kit exists to fix both: it pre-digests official Apple documentation into small, atomic, traceable Knowledge Contracts, and routes an agent to exactly the ones a task needs via deterministic Skills — not semantic search over the whole repo. The result is lower token cost per task, more consistent output across sessions, and a clear paper trail back to the Apple documentation that justifies each rule.

## Goals

- Reduce token usage
- Improve routing accuracy
- Increase implementation consistency
- Preserve traceability to Apple documentation
- Scale to hundreds of reusable Knowledge Contracts

## Installation

Install the Claude Code plugin via the npx installer:

```bash
npx apple-agent-kit
```

This adds this repository as a Claude Code plugin marketplace and installs the `apple-agent-kit` plugin, so its Skills, Knowledge Contracts, and routing become available inside Claude Code sessions. Requires the `claude` CLI to already be installed.

Codex CLI users: the same installer detects `codex` and prints install instructions instead of erroring. See [.codex/INSTALL.md](.codex/INSTALL.md) for the plugin-marketplace command and a manual clone-and-symlink fallback.

Workflows

## Workflows

A Workflow composes several Skills into one task that no single domain owns. Routing matches Workflows first: if the task spans more than one of the Skills a Workflow names, that Workflow is loaded and sequences them; otherwise exactly one Skill is loaded.

- **`authentication`** — Build a sign-in feature end to end: wording, form accessibility, Sign in with Apple, biometric re-auth, Keychain storage. → [WORKFLOW.md](workflows/authentication/WORKFLOW.md)
- **`app-store-submission`** — Review-guideline compliance and privacy declaration, gated ahead of signing, archive, and export. → [WORKFLOW.md](workflows/app-store-submission/WORKFLOW.md)
- **`add-widget`** — Widget surface, its configuration and interaction intents, and the background refresh that keeps its timeline current. → [WORKFLOW.md](workflows/add-widget/WORKFLOW.md)

## Skills

Skills route a task to the minimum set of Knowledge Contracts it needs. Invoke them with a specific task, not a broad topic request — name the concrete thing you're doing (e.g. "check this screen's layout against HIG"), not "tell me about HIG."

## What's New

- 2026-08-23 — Codex CLI support landed. This repo's Skills are now loadable from OpenAI's Codex CLI, not just Claude Code, with zero changes to any Knowledge Contract, Skill, Reference, or Workflow — Codex reads the same `SKILL.md` files directly via a single repo-root manifest, `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, that points at the existing `skills/` directory as a whole. No per-domain translation file exists or is needed. `.codex/INSTALL.md` documents both install paths (Codex's plugin marketplace, or a manual clone-and-symlink fallback), and `npx apple-agent-kit` now detects a Codex-only environment and prints the right instructions instead of erroring.
- 2026-08-23 — Tier 2's 78 Knowledge Contracts and 17 Skills finished their first full pass through every Level 4 check, L4.1 through L4.5. The last of those, L4.5 — does the page a rule cites actually say what it's quoted as saying — had been explicitly left open by two earlier reviews because answering it means fetching live Apple documentation, not just reading the repository. Fetching it found what reading alone never could: fourteen fabricated-but-plausible quotes attached to otherwise-correct rules, a pair of stale rule-number citations, and one rule whose entire premise — that PassKit ships no SwiftUI equivalent for adding a pass to Wallet — had gone false the moment Apple shipped one, silently invalidating a coupling an earlier review had verified under the premise that held when it was written.
- 2026-08-09 — The two-domain experiment was tested the way it was meant to be tested, and it passed with one gap. The idea under test: settle in writing, before any rule is authored, every boundary a new domain shares with the existing ones. Nine such boundaries were settled for the photo and location domains, and until now the only evidence they worked came from the person writing to them — not from someone using the result. So a realistic feature was put through the kit end to end: pick photos from the library, show where each one was taken, and react when the user comes back to that place later with the app closed. Four of the settled boundaries were exercised and all four held, including the one an agent is most likely to get wrong. The gap is elsewhere, and it is the interesting part: the photo library hands back a location — the place a photo was taken travels with the photo, and reading it needs no location permission at all — but neither domain said so, so a feature asking that question either stopped with nothing or asked the user for a permission it would never use. The reason nobody wrote it down is that the boundaries were settled by walking each new domain against the domains that already existed, which cannot see the seam between two domains built at the same time. That is now a written rule, along with the review question that would have caught it.
